      "User: What do you know about LangGraph?\n",
      "Assistant: LangGraph is a framework for building stateful, multi-agent applications using large language models (LLMs). It builds on top of LangChain and implements principles from the Actor framework to enable creation of complex, stateful AI agents and workflows. LangGraph allows developers to define agents with memory and state that can interact with each other and external tools/APIs. It's designed to facilitate building more sophisticated AI systems and applications that go beyond simple question-answering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some key features and concepts of LangGraph include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Stateful agents: Agents can maintain state and memory across interactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Multi-agent systems: Allows creation of systems with multiple interacting agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Workflow management: Provides tools for defining and managing complex workflows between agents and other components.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Integration with LangChain: Builds on LangChain's components and tools for working with LLMs.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Actor model principles: Implements concepts from the Actor framework for concurrent, distributed systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Flexibility: Can be used to create a wide range of AI applications, from chatbots to more complex decision-making systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "LangGraph is relatively new and still evolving, so its capabilities and best practices may continue to develop over time. It's primarily used by developers and researchers working on advanced AI applications that require stateful, multi-agent architectures.\n"
